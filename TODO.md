# General

- 'maxdate' on an Active position should be set to today. Somehow it isn't.
  Urgent.

- Convert all enums to have the same capitalized style.
- Convert 'P' and 'C' to 'PUT' and 'CALL'

- Add 'Index Option' as instype for CBOE indices.

- Finish support for straight up equities.

- Write clear documentation on how to produce inputs on each platform.

- Chains: Add number of adjustments
- Chains: Infer initial strategy and add column

- Add tags

- Add bottom line with sums of partial selections

- Create a local database, inferring initial positions from differential

- Make this public, finalize license

- Add tgtcost%

- Add beta-weighted deltas to multiple references by group (e.g. energy not on
  SPX)

- Add custom mapping of underlying to whatever custom field (e.g. "base", for
  copper from /HG and FCX).

- Include the first 20 minutes of trading in initial credits

- Fix "days" to round up.


- Compute beta-weighted adjusted values yourself (for better betas).
- Add % BP per trade, should be 3-5%.
- Render total % BP used and available, should be 35%.
- Compute notional equivalent exposure.
- Add correlation matrix between the major asset classes (oil, bonds, stocks, etc.).
- Create a metric of delta, strategy and duration diversification.
- Create a distribution of BPR size over Net Liq, should be 1-2%


# Personal

- Complete categorizing all trades


# Bugs

- The tgtinit% of ratio spreads is incorrect


# Config

- Create account name mapping, the account numbers shouldn't appear in anywhere.
  Needs nicknames, which means, needs a configuration file.

- Read and support proto config.

- Support account name mapping, the account numbers shouldn't appear in
  anywhere. Needs nicknames, which means, needs a configuration file.

- Finish support for annotations and explicit chains.


# Database

- Implement storing already imported data and partial import â€” So you don't have
  to scroll endlessly like an idiot in TW.

- Fetch prices at open, make options at zero, should work fine.
  Fetch IVs.


# Ameritrade

- Fix filters from ConsolidateChains that were created to isolate Core
  positions. Make this fully general and able to consume long stock as well.

- Parse positions from the account statement in order to get net_liq, as an
  alternative to the positions download (well, which contains greeks).


# Interactive

- Implement equivalent IB converter for transactions and positions.


# Vanguard

- Implement converter


# Risk

- Add notional risk for all instruments
- Append BPR to the table
- Fetch IVs for each of the positions and compute estimate of 1SD and 2SD risk.


# Stats

- Render the histograms smaller, and in a way that lends a nice rectangle for sharing.

- Add commissions and fees, as amount and % of total



# Bugs

- Untangle SPCE earnings - group by expiration, unless there's a rolling trade
  (with same order id). Split off different expirations for chains.

- What's up with this one?

      210111_111922.RUT

- Fix bugs with multiple underlyings:

      MULTIPLE UNDERLYINGS: x1287.210415_104721.NGM21 {'/NGN21', '/NGM21'}
      MULTIPLE UNDERLYINGS: x1227.210426_150842.ZTM21 {'/ZTU21', '/ZTM21'}
      MULTIPLE UNDERLYINGS: x1227.210326_102451.ZCZ21 {'/ZCN21', '/ZCZ21'}

- pygraphviz: Why do matches connect to other matches? Write unit tests.

- Support ALL positions, don't remove Ledger. Or perhaps make the Ledger core
  positions included. This separation just isn't working properly.


- Why didn't PLTR get lumped into the earnings trade?
- These should be merged:
  210510_142056.PLTR
  210511_093011.PLTR
